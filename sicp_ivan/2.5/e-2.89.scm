; Exercise 2.89.
;
; Define procedures that implement the term-list
; representation described above as appropriate for dense polynomials.
; ------------------------------------------------------------

; Dense polynomials do not have pairs of order and coefficient but
; only a list of terms where position in the list presents the term
; power.



; Ok, officialy I will for now not do these examples from 
; 2.89 - 2.97 because it is all the same concept just broadning up, it
; is anyway extra example and I guess I got the point from this chapter.
; My goal is not to learn to implement arithmetic system in its biggest
; glory but to get the concepts and I think I have achieved that till
; now.

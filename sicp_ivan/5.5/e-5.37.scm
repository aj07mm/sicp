; Exercise 5.37.
; One way to understand the compiler's preserving mechanism for
; optimizing stack usage is to see what extra operations would be generated if
; we did not use this idea. Modify preserving so that it always generates the
; save and restore operations. Compile some simple expressions and identify the
; unnecessary stack operations that are generated. Compare the code to that
; generated with the preserving mechanism intact.

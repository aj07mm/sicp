; Exercise 5.10.
;
; Design a new syntax for register-machine instructions and
; modify the simulator to use your new syntax. Can you implement your new
; syntax without changing any part of the simulator except the syntax
; procedures in this section?
; ------------------------------------------------------------

; This is more or less repetition of the concept introduced with the
; metalingustic abstractions. It is possible to isolate the way language of the
; controller looks like and how it is executed in the register machine and to
; change its syntax only with small modifications in the syntax related procedures.

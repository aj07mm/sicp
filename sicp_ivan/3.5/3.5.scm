; iterative way to sum the primes
(define (sum-primes a b)

  (iter a 0))

; (output (sum-primes 10 20))

; Now if we write the same in the stream processing style
(define (sum-primes a b)
  (accumulate +
             0
             (filter prime?
                     (enumerate-interval a b))))


; (output (sum-primes 10 20))

; This approach looks much better abstracted and modularized,
; but has one problem. (enumerate-interval) will first produce
; all the elements of the interval and only ten filtering is going
; to produce next list of fitlered values and only then it will
; be passed to accumulate for folding. This means lot of memory usage
; for long lists.

; (output (sum-primes 1 1000000)) ; This will take some time and space

; Other part of inefficiency is, what if we want only one element out
; of all of them. Then we don't need to construct the whole enumerated list.
; (car (cdr (filter prime? (enumerate-interval 1000 1000000))))

; In orer to solve these problems, we can introduce streams.
; They are similar as lists, and they share with them a lot of properties, and
; as well adding some new ones.
;
; They are described by the following abstraction.
; (stream-car (cons-stream x y)) = x
; (stream-cdr (const-stream x y)) = y
; the-empty-stream object
; and the constructor (const-stream x y)

; we have to define cons-stream as macro.
; This is because if we do (cons-stream a b) as a procedure
; call, then expression b will be evaluated before application of
; the procedure (cons-stream)
; This way, as a macro, it is first syntactically transformed to
; delayed version and then executed.
(define-syntax cons-stream
  (syntax-rules ()

; now we have procedures to manipualate streams, but we still don't have stream
; implementation.
;
; We will implement streams with the help of (delay) function where.
; (cons-stream a b) is equal to
; (cons a (delay b))
;
; This means, that (cdr) of the stream will not be a concrete value but it will be
; the promise to calculate it when we need it, and not before that
; we are still missing the parts (delay) and (force) to implement
; streams fully

; (define (force delayed-object)
;   (delayed-object))

; there is one optimization we can do in order not to evaluate same delayed stream
; more than once. We make small closure with the internal status variable and the
; result of computation

(define (stream-car stream) (car stream))
(define (stream-cdr stream) (force (cdr stream)))
; to finalize the definition

(define the-empty-stream '())
(define (stream-null? stream) (null? stream))

; delay and force need to be special constructs implemented
; in the lower level of language because they don't bahave
; as ordinary procedures, so we take them as defined

; Given these primitives we can write our inefficient example

; (stream-car
;   (stream-cdr
;     (stream-filter prime?
;                    (stream-enumerate-interval 10000 1000000))))

; we need some more things to implement

(define (stream-enumerate-interval low high)
  (if (> low high)
    the-empty-stream
    (cons-stream low
                 (stream-enumerate-interval (+ low 1) high))))

; From the previous we can see that streams are as lists, just that they

; Extending this principle, we can then define even infinite streams.

; Based on the principle that we can do iteration in a way that we affect tail of the stream,

; Using streams we can generate not only streams of simple elements but

; As said, streams can be used to represent signals in the sigal processing systems.
;
; Integrator for example:

(define (integral integrand initial-value dt)
  (define int
    (cons-stream initial-value
                 (add-streams (scale-stream integrand dt)
                              int)))
  int)


; Lot of these solutions are based on the fact that execution of the
; tail of the stream is going to be delayed.
; But there are places where we could use this delayed executio as well. For example
; for solving the differential equations.

; Exercise 1.32.
;
; a. Show that sum and product (exercise 1.31) are both special cases of a still 
;    more general notion called accumulate that combines a collection of terms,
;    using some general accumulation function:
;
; (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
;
; Accumulate takes as arguments the same term and range specifications as sum and product,
; together with a combiner procedure (of two arguments) that specifies how the current
; term is to be combined with the accumulation of the preceding terms and a null-value
; that specifies what base value to use when the terms run out. Write accumulate and show
; how sum and product can both be defined as simple calls to accumulate.
;
; b. If your accumulate procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates
;    an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates
;    a recursive process.

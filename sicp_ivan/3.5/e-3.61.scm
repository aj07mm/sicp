; Exercise 3.61.  Let S be a power series (exercise 3.59) whose constant
; term is 1. Suppose we want to find the power series 1/S, that is, the
; series X such that S Â· X = 1. Write S = 1 + SR where SR is the part of
; S after the constant term. Then we can solve for X as follows:
;
; S*X         = 1
; (1 + Sr)*X  = 1
; X + Sr*X    = 1
;
; therefore => X = 1 + Sr*X
;
;
; In other words, X is the power series whose constant term is 1 and
; whose higher-order terms are given by the negative of SR times X. Use
; this idea to write a procedure invert-unit-series that computes 1/S
; for a power series S with constant term 1. You will need to use
; mul-series from exercise 3.60.
; ------------------------------------------------------------

; Having already developed basic series and streams manipulation
; procedures, we can write it like this.

(load "../helpers.scm")
(load "3.5.scm")

(define (invert-unit-series stream)
  (cons-stream 1
               (negate-series (mul-series (stream-cdr stream)
                                          (invert-unit-series stream)))))

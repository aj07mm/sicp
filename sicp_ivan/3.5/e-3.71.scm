; Exercise 3.71.
;
; Numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in more
; than one way are sometimes called Ramanujan numbers, in honor of the
; mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.70 Ordered streams of pairs provide an
; elegant solution to the problem of computing these numbers. To find a number
; that can be written as the sum of two cubes in two different ways, we need
; only generate the stream of pairs of integers (i,j) weighted according to the
; sum i3 + j3 (see exercise 3.70), then search the stream for two consecutive
; pairs with the same weight. Write a procedure to generate the Ramanujan
; numbers. The first such number is 1,729. What are the next five?

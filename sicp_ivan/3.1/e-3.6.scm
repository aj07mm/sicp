; Exercise 3.6.
;
; It is useful to be able to reset a random-number generator to
; produce a sequence starting from a given value. Design a new rand procedure
; that is called with an argument that is either the symbol generate or the
; symbol reset and behaves as follows: (rand 'generate) produces a new random
; number; ((rand 'reset) <new-value>) resets the internal state variable to the
; designated <new-value>. Thus, by resetting the state, one can generate
; repeatable sequences. These are very handy to have when testing and debugging
; programs that use random numbers.
; ------------------------------------------------------------

; This is not that difficult ot do when we know the technique of message passing.
; Rand is not object that contains local state and two actions 'generate and 'reset

(load "../helpers.scm")

; practically we have to define our random number generator.

; first initializer
(define random-init
  (inexact->exact (current-milliseconds)))

; and how we update random number every time randomization is called.
; @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation
;
; I will use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator with some predefined constants
; just for sake of the simplicity
;
; m = 19 (primary number)
; a = 3
; c = 5

; Probably incorrect but for simplicity just to explain what it means to build random sequence generator
; this should be sufficient. For more information read a bit more on the topic of random/pseudo
; random number generation
;
; maximum number this generator can produce is m (which we have to define significantly high for big seqs)
(define random-update
  (let ((m 19)
        (a 3)
        (c 5))
    (lambda (x)
      (modulo (+ (* a x) c) m))))

; and randomization procedure to expose
; message handler action
(define rand
  (let ((x random-init))
    (lambda (m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'generate)
             (begin
               (set! x (random-update x))
               x))
            ((eq? m 'reset)
             (lambda (value)
               (set! x value)))))))

; this is initialized by random-init
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))

; here we set the seed on our own
; (output "reseting")
; ((rand 'reset) 10)
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))

; here we reset the sequence
; (output "reseting")
; ((rand 'reset) 10)
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))
; (output (rand 'generate))

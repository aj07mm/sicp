# Metalinguistic abstraction

## Controlling complexity by using appropriate languages

Previously, we have seen that way to control complexity was building
abstractions by combining primitive elements into more complex ones,
abstracting them and using them further as primitive elements in new,
even higher-level, abstractions. We were using Scheme to build these
abstractions.

Often, programming language itself is not powerful enough to express all
the abstractions in the domain we are working in. Therefore we have to
create custom language of the domain. This way we can more natively
reason about the problem of the domain and deal with complexity in
simpler way.

Establishing new languages is called `Metalinguistic abstraction` and is
an ubiquitous way of dealing with complexity.
